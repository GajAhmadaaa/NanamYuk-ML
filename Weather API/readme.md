# Getting weather data from a city
We are using OpenWeatherMap API to get weather data. 

> *[OpenWeatherMap](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/OpenWeatherMap) is an online service, owned by OpenWeather Ltd, that provides global weather data via API, including current weather data, forecasts, nowcasts and historical weather data for any geographical location.*

OpenWeatherMap is *free* to use but have some limitations. If you want to try deploying this project you should have at least Developer plans.
You can see the pricing [here](https://openweathermap.org/price).

##### But, if you are a student, you can get a free 6-month access [here](https://openweathermap.org/our-initiatives/student-initiative)
