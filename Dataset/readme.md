## What we do
We are trying to collect temperature, humidity, soil, light and rainfall data for 5 ornamental plants, 5 vegetable crops and 3 additional plants (12 plants in total) that suitable for every plant.

We are collecting data from many reliable source on the internet. Here is the documentation on [Trello](https://trello.com/b/bS1cttt8/plant-dataset).

After the data is collected, we put it together into [Google Sheet](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1_5j6S77H6_rNY3lQ5s5VSfl4yd6xK_gARiiF8QsvBHo/edit#gid=0), then we generate a dataset using pandas and numpy module within the range of suitable environment for every plant and save it in csv format.
